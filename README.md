# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

To host your React project on GitHub Pages, you need to update the `homepage` field in your `package.json` file. This field should be set to the URL where your site will be hosted. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name",
  "dependencies": {
    // your dependencies here
  }
}
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-repo-name` with the name of your repository.
